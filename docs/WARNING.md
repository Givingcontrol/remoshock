# Warning

## Electricity

Please be very careful when playing with electricity because electricity
my cause serious medical issues. This includes both an impact on the
nerve system as well as damage to the skin.

### Nerves

### Skin

### Why did you publish this software anyway?

This is a good question. I hesitated for several months whether I should
actually release it. 

It started as a lock-down project in order to have something to do and
learn Arduino. After I got familiar with hardware-near programming,
I bought a pair of cheap shock collars which are operating on 433 MHz.
This worked well from the software point of view.

But I am quite unhappy about those receivers. They seem to be significantly
more dangerous than a PAC collar with regard to damaging the skin.
They have a very different pulse-form and - I think - significantly higher
current in addition to high voltage.

Unfortunately it is this kind of collar, for which there is plenty of 
code available on the Internet. Furthermore, I assume based on
published photos, that a famous expensive commercial APP-controlled
shocking device uses the same kind of collar.

All in all: Do not play with electricity! But if you do, please be careful
and use high quality products.
