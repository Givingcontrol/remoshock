# Warning

Please be very careful when playing with electricity.
Electricity my cause serious medical issues.

This includes both an impact on the nerve system as well as damage
to the skin.

Shock collars from different vendors have very different 
characteristics. Personally, I think a PAC collar on low setting 
causes a dull pain. But a Petainer, even on level 1, has an
extremely piercing feeling.

I don't have proper equipment to measure the output. But from the feeling
I am guessing that the later uses a significantly higher current and
therefore has a significantly higher risk of damaging the skin.

For personal experience I can tell, that even a PAC collar can create 
skin damage that is still visible after 9 month.
